1.  knife.rb  should use ENV VARS in knife file, not explicit values
2.  knife.rb needs security zone
3.  chef setup and other scripts should switch / choose ami based on security zone, and set these ami values somewhere
4.  chef setp should create security groups needed if they are specified
    i can get this to work
